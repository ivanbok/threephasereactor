This matlab files include simulation code to determine the parameters for a three-phase trickle bed reactor
designed for the hydrogenation of anthraquinones to produce hydrogen peroxide. 

To determine the best design, a total cost optimisation script was also created to iterate over multiple scenarios
and reaction conditions to develop the lowest cost design that is capable of meeting the product specifications. 

For each new scenario, the specifications for the reactor can be easily tweaked. Additional documentation will
be provided for instructions on how to do so.
